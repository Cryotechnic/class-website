        <h1>My Plans for reaching them</h1>
        <ul>
          <p>I am already well on my way to learn JavaScript, however I am still not that comfortable<br>
            around it. With the help of my Web Development teacher, I believe I will be able to expand my skills in the language<br>
          and learn much more.</p>
          <p>My portfolio website is well underway already, and I am waiting on JavaScript to finish implementing the features I want.</p>
          <p>This is probably one of the longest and hardest tasks I've set for myself. I want to learn how the frameworks and libraries work<br>
          and use them to enhance my portfolio. I feel like this goal is the one I may not achieve simply because there is a lot to learn, <br>
        and not a lot of time to do so. However, I hope to be able to learn at least one (1) framework & library before the end of summer.</p>
        <p>This point is a goal I am about to achieve as well. I have applied to many different companies and am waiting to hear their responses.</p>
        </ul>
